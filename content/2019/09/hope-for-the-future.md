Today a child taught me there is hope. Our global environmental situation is a scary one. It’s easy to feel hopeless. 

For the last month since returning to the US from Asia, I have felt hopeless. There are so many changes needed and anything I do has so little effect. At least that’s how it feels.

Today I saw a young boy teaching another young child how to recycle. He stopped the child from throwing away a recyclable and took the child over to the recycle bin instead. It was such a small thing, but it filled me with hope. 

Maybe our hope for the future is safe. Maybe we need to trust in the kids around us, teach them well, and support them as they change the world in ways we couldn’t.

We don’t get to be Daniel LaRusso. But we can be Mr. Miyagi.
