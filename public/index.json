For the past couple of months Iâ€™ve been using the Bullet Journal method. I like it, but it is restrictive. Sometimes I find myself just not writing because I donâ€™t want to decide how to categorize or add something to my index. I appreciate some aspects of the system, but not all are for me. I am coming to the end of a notebook and I wanted to make an adjustment so I can make better use of the new one.","keywords":null,"title":"My New Journal Mashup","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/journal-mashup/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Notebooks","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/categories/notebooks/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Systems","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/categories/systems/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Tags","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/tags/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Browsers","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/categories/browsers/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Digital Security","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/categories/digital-security/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"DuckDuckGo","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/tags/duckduckgo/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"HTTPS","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/tags/https/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Privacy","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/categories/privacy/"},{"categories":["Privacy","Digital Security","Browsers"],"content":"We all need to be a bit more invisible on the internet.

You see, we have made some major moves in our 16 years together, including two international moves that basically forced us to start over from zero. the one place we were able to keep some mementos was in my parentsâ€™ basement.

I loved it, and spent the better part of an evening implementing many of the recommendations on my phone. There were several recommended apps that I had never heard of that I set off to explore, including one called â€ŽZero â€” Fasting Tracker. I downloaded it and started to do some research on Intermittent Fasting, the practice the app helps you track.","keywords":null,"title":"How Intermittent Fasting has helped my relationship with food","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/intermittentfasting/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Fundraising","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/categories/fundraising/"},{"categories":["Fundraising"],"content":"Over the past 11 months I have served as the president of the board of a small 501(3)c nonprofit in my hometown, the Many Moods Choir and Orchestra.

It comes with so many negative connotations, especially in our era of internet skulldugery, intensive tracking, and less-than-honest tactics. Seth Godin said it best:\n Online marketing has become a messy mix of direct marketing, seo, tricks, tips, code and guesswork. Itâ€™s an always-moving target and itâ€™s mostly focused on tactics, not strategy, because tactics are easy to measure.\nMarketing online, on the other hand, is what happens when the work to serve our audience arrives in an electronic form.","keywords":null,"title":"About","uri":"https://hammock.marketing/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Adam Tervort works in software, marketing, and education.
