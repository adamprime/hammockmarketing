<p>Back in November I ran across an excellent article on Medium about How to Configure Your iPhone to Work for You, Not Against You. I loved it, and spent the better part of an evening implementing many of the recommendations on my phone. There were several recommended apps that I had never heard of that I set off to explore, including one called ‎Zero — Fasting Tracker. I downloaded it and started to do some research on Intermittent Fasting, the practice the app helps you track.</p>

<h2 id="the-what-of-intermittent-fasting">The What of Intermittent Fasting</h2>

<p>I was raised in a household that practiced dry fasting one day per month, so I’m not a stranger to fasting, though it was also one of the things I hated most and tried my hardest to dodge. (Which is hilarious because my kids now try the same things to get out of it that I tried for all of my childhood. As if they could play a player! 😂)</p>

<p>Intermittent Fasting (or IF) is different than the fasting I had experience with. While there are a number of variations, the principle is simple: don’t take in calories for a certain number of hours between dinner and your next meal. Drinking water or drinks with no calories is fine, but eating is not. I use the 16:8 IF variation, with a 16 hour fast and an eight hour window for eating.</p>

<p>This isn’t really a diet since you can eat whatever you want during the time you’re not fasting. This is one of the things that appealed to me most — it’s dead simple. Don’t eat when you’re fasting, and eat when it’s time to eat. No restrictions, no food logging. Easy as pie 🍰.</p>

<h2 id="how-if-has-helped-me">How IF has helped me</h2>

<p>I wouldn’t say I have a bad relationship with food, but it’s definitely complicated. Guilt around eating is a very real thing for me. IF has helped.</p>

<p>The first immediate change I noticed was that I stopped snacking. After the first two days, which were hard, I stopped eating anything between meals. (The routine I have been following is fasting from after dinner, usually starting at 6 pm, until at least 10 am. The eating window starts then and ends at 6 pm.) I eat a good lunch, have a nice dinner with my family, and don’t really eat anything in between. It’s not that I’m trying not to snack; it just hasn’t happened. This is a big change for me.</p>

<p>I have been able to use IF as a trigger for new habits. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> When I get hungry in the morning I make a cup of herbal tea or fizzy water. This helps tide me over until lunch and is a great time to do a mindful activity. I started writing in my journal during this morning tea time, another habit I’ve tried and failed to be consistent at in the past. Being more mindful isn’t a strictly physical benefit of IF, but it’s had a very real effect for me.</p>

<p>There have been some good physical changes as well. I have lost some weight. Nothing dramatic, but enough that it’s about time to go buy some new pants. My skin is clearer than it’s been in years. I have more energy, particularly in the afternoon. (I haven’t had a post-lunch lull since I started with IF.)</p>

<p>I also feel particularly clear headed and sharp in the mornings. I’m a morning person and tend to get all of my most important tasks for the day done before 10 am. This was actually my main concern before starting IF — if I’m tearing-my-hair-out hungry during my most productive time of the day then the quality of my work will be in the toilet. The exact opposite has happened. I am able to focus and power through tasks in the morning, which makes the rest of the day much better.</p>

<h2 id="resources-on-if">Resources on IF</h2>

<p>Here are a few of articles and videos I found helpful in learning and practicing IF:</p>

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">The Beginner’s Guide to Intermittent Fasting</a> from James Clear. This was the first article about IF I read and one that helped me decide to give it a try.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/">A Beginner’s Guide to Intermittent Fasting | Nerd Fitness</a> from Nerd Fitness. They cover a lot of information in a really fun way. This is a good place to start if you feel intimidated by the concept of fasting.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156">Intermittent fasting: Surprising update</a> Some research here, as well as a good list of further reading at the bottom.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#weight-loss">Intermittent Fasting 101 — The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide</a>. This article covers much of what is covered in the other articles, but with excellent source citations. If you’re interested in learning research-based facts on how IF works this an excellent resource. This article makes a strong case about the benefits of IF in fighting insulin resistance. This is a big deal for me as my family has a history of type 2 diabetes.</li>
