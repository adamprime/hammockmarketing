For 10 years I lived in the wonderful land of Taiwan. Itâ€™s safe, filled with really great people, and relatively cheap. Sure I missed my family and friends back in the US, but technology meant we could have video chats and phone calls which helped a lot.

The thing I missed the most was the libraries!

The library in my hometown is more than just a place to check out books. It has internet access, nice areas to work or read, educational programs, access to materials from nearly any library in the country, and knowledgable staff. The digital resources it gives patrons access to largely replace the need for an Audible or Kindle Unlimited subscription, or the need to buy online courses. Itâ€™s an amazing place.

Since we moved back it has become one of the places our family gravitates to. I love seeing my kids curled up with a book. I also love seeing my wife get excited for the free classes they offer. 

[September is Library Card Sign-up Month](http://www.ilovelibraries.org/library-card). If you donâ€™t have one yet, please seek out your local library and get a card. Take a friend or family member with you and get them one too.

We pay for libraries with our taxes. Get the most value for that money paid by being a frequent patron. I personally earmark my tax dollars to go towards libraries and national parks. ðŸ˜‰
