Marketing is a funny word. It comes with so many negative connotations, especially in our era of internet skulldugery, intensive tracking, and less-than-honest tactics. [Seth Godin said it best](https://seths.blog/2019/08/online-marketing-vs-marketing-online/):

> Online marketing has become a messy mix of direct marketing, seo, tricks, tips, code and guesswork. It’s an always-moving target and it’s mostly focused on tactics, not strategy, because tactics are easy to measure.
>
> Marketing online, on the other hand, is what happens when the work to serve our audience arrives in an electronic form. Marketing online is simply marketing–the act of making things better by making things–aided by a mouse and a keyboard.

My goal is to share my work with you through this site in a way that hopefully makes things better for you. I work in the software world but try to spend most of my time outside of work in the analog world. My hope is that you find value in the things I share here.

Why Hammock Marketing? I have a soft spot for hammocks. They make life better, just like good marketing.
