Today I watched an amazing jazz pianist play in a way that filled me with joy. Yes, he was teaching a class full of young vocalists who don’t always hit the right notes or come in at the right time. This wasn’t a gala performance at the Kennedy Center. But his playing was both superb and infectious. It made me want to get out an instrument and practice! 

Seeing mastery in action is amazing and awe inspiring. We don’t see the years of hard practice, the disappointments and trials that shaped the artistry we hear today. But knowing those things were part of his journey in one way or another make celebrating his achievements even more fun. 

Here is someone who strives! In that moment I heard beauty, joy, and soul come out of his playing. I’m so grateful for the artists who make experiences like this possible. 

Now if you’ll excuse me I’m going to go and practice making some art.

For those that are curious, the amazing pianist is [Mr. Charles Williams](https://www.charleswilliamspiano.com/). He teaches at the Kansas City Jazz Academy and two of my children have the privilege of studying with him there.
