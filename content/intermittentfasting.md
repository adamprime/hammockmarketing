Back in November I ran across an excellent article on Medium about How to Configure Your iPhone to Work for You, Not Against You. I loved it, and spent the better part of an evening implementing many of the recommendations on my phone. There were several recommended apps that I had never heard of that I set off to explore, including one called ‎Zero — Fasting Tracker. I downloaded it and started to do some research on Intermittent Fasting, the practice the app helps you track.

## The What of Intermittent Fasting

I was raised in a household that practiced dry fasting one day per month, so I’m not a stranger to fasting, though it was also one of the things I hated most and tried my hardest to dodge. (Which is hilarious because my kids now try the same things to get out of it that I tried for all of my childhood. As if they could play a player! 😂)

Intermittent Fasting (or IF) is different than the fasting I had experience with. While there are a number of variations, the principle is simple: don’t take in calories for a certain number of hours between dinner and your next meal. Drinking water or drinks with no calories is fine, but eating is not. I use the 16:8 IF variation, with a 16 hour fast and an eight hour window for eating.

This isn’t really a diet since you can eat whatever you want during the time you’re not fasting. This is one of the things that appealed to me most — it’s dead simple. Don’t eat when you’re fasting, and eat when it’s time to eat. No restrictions, no food logging. Easy as pie 🍰.

## How IF has helped me

I wouldn’t say I have a bad relationship with food, but it’s definitely complicated. Guilt around eating is a very real thing for me. IF has helped.

The first immediate change I noticed was that I stopped snacking. After the first two days, which were hard, I stopped eating anything between meals. (The routine I have been following is fasting from after dinner, usually starting at 6 pm, until at least 10 am. The eating window starts then and ends at 6 pm.) I eat a good lunch, have a nice dinner with my family, and don’t really eat anything in between. It’s not that I’m trying not to snack; it just hasn’t happened. This is a big change for me.

I have been able to use IF as a trigger for new habits. [^1] When I get hungry in the morning I make a cup of herbal tea or fizzy water. This helps tide me over until lunch and is a great time to do a mindful activity. I started writing in my journal during this morning tea time, another habit I’ve tried and failed to be consistent at in the past. Being more mindful isn’t a strictly physical benefit of IF, but it’s had a very real effect for me.

There have been some good physical changes as well. I have lost some weight. Nothing dramatic, but enough that it’s about time to go buy some new pants. My skin is clearer than it’s been in years. I have more energy, particularly in the afternoon. (I haven’t had a post-lunch lull since I started with IF.)

I also feel particularly clear headed and sharp in the mornings. I’m a morning person and tend to get all of my most important tasks for the day done before 10 am. This was actually my main concern before starting IF — if I’m tearing-my-hair-out hungry during my most productive time of the day then the quality of my work will be in the toilet. The exact opposite has happened. I am able to focus and power through tasks in the morning, which makes the rest of the day much better.

## Resources on IF

Here are a few of articles and videos I found helpful in learning and practicing IF:

### Articles

- [The Beginner’s Guide to Intermittent Fasting](https://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting) from James Clear. This was the first article about IF I read and one that helped me decide to give it a try.
- [A Beginner’s Guide to Intermittent Fasting | Nerd Fitness](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/) from Nerd Fitness. They cover a lot of information in a really fun way. This is a good place to start if you feel intimidated by the concept of fasting.
- [Intermittent fasting: Surprising update](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156) Some research here, as well as a good list of further reading at the bottom.
- [Intermittent Fasting 101 — The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#weight-loss). This article covers much of what is covered in the other articles, but with excellent source citations. If you’re interested in learning research-based facts on how IF works this an excellent resource. This article makes a strong case about the benefits of IF in fighting insulin resistance. This is a big deal for me as my family has a history of type 2 diabetes.
- [5 Intermittent Fasting Methods: Which One Is Best for You?](https://dailyburn.com/life/health/intermittent-fasting-methods/). Overview of various IF methods in a more structured regimen than what I’m doing now.

### Videos

- [How to do Intermittent Fasting: Complete Guide](https://youtu.be/LLVf3d0rqqY) — YouTube from Thomas DeLauer. This guy has built his business and fitness principles around IF and gives good practical advice.
- [How to do Intermittent Fasting for Serious Weight Loss](https://youtu.be/lwCRjwDs1Ek). This gives a good overview of IF. The method he pushes leads towards a 20:4 fast, which I’ve tried a few days. The hardest part of this is scheduling time to eat 😂

### Apps

- [Introducing “Zero,” a new app to help you fast](https://medium.com/@kevinrose/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d) — Kevin Rose — Medium This is the app I use to track fasts. Very unobtrusive and helpful.
